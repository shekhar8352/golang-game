## Gameplay
The game simulates combat between two players with the following attributes:
- **Health**: Represents the player's life. When it reaches 0, the player dies.
- **Strength**: Used in defense; it reduces the damage from incoming attacks.
- **Attack**: Represents the player's attacking power. Higher attack means more damage.

Players attack and defend by rolling dice:
- **Attacking Dice**: A 6-sided die rolled by the attacker.
- **Defending Dice**: A 6-sided die rolled by the defender.

### Example Combat
1. **Player A** rolls a 5 on the attacking die and has an attack of 10. Attack damage is calculated as `5 * 10 = 50`.
2. **Player B** rolls a 2 on the defending die and has a strength of 10. Defended damage is calculated as `2 * 10 = 20`.
3. Player Bâ€™s health is reduced by the difference (`50 - 20 = 30`).

Players continue attacking and defending in turns until one player's health reaches 0.

## Game Rules
1. Players take turns attacking and defending.
2. The player with the lower health attacks first.
3. The game ends when one player's health reaches 0.
